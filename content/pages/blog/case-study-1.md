Myo Tun, a 25-year-old from Mandalay, faced immense challenges as a member of the LGBT community in Myanmar. Growing up in a conservative society, Myo experienced discrimination, bullying, and social exclusion due to his sexual orientation. Despite these hardships, he found support through HOPE Myanmar's LGBT initiatives. Through our comprehensive programs, Myo received mental health counseling, legal assistance, and access to sexual health services. Participating in our capacity-building workshops, Myo gained confidence and leadership skills, eventually becoming an advocate for LGBT rights in his community. His journey from isolation to empowerment highlights the critical role of support networks in fostering resilience and creating inclusive environments for marginalized individuals.
